# Automated-voice-stone-paper-scissor-game
Automated Voice interactive stone paper and scissor game.
# Intro
It's a short python stone, paper, and scissor game build on python. The game has capability to understand voice inputs given by the user/client making it a different attracting audio enable machine interactive artificial intelligence game. Also very useful for visually challenged people helping them to interact with this technology and enjoy interactive gameplay.
# Get started [user]
1. User/client has just to input for how many rounds to be played.
2. The machine starts to interact and now just sit and relax.
3. The machine will automatically start to interact with the user and asks him/her for his/her choices.
4. Game rules:
5. The game consisting of three choices a.e. stone, paper, and scissors. The user has to take ( say a choice with the help of voice input) and the machine randomly selects its choice and then if the winning conditions (if stone and paper are choices = paper wins, stone and scissor = stone wins, paper and scissor = scissor win and so on) are in favor of the user, the user gets +1 point against the machine and vice-versa.
6. Now after the preferred numbers of rounds the machine calculates the numbers of points and announces vocally the winner.
# Get started [Developer]
File Contains:
1. main_automated_voice_stone_paper_scissor_game.py 
2. test_requirement_modules_packages.py 
3. main_automated_voice_stone_paper_scissor_game.py, Consisting of main code file where the finall modules/packages are imported and the methods, architecture of game and runner                                                       file is collabed.
4. test_requirement_modules_packages.py is for Refference file for modules and packages needed to run the game/programm.
# Real time uses and scope.
This type of project can be implemented for contactless playing enjoyment just as a person is sitting with the user/client. Also very useful for visually challenged people helping them to interact with this technology and enjoy interactive gameplay.
